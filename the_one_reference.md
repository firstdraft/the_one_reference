## `ActiveRecord_Relation` (array of records)

### All `Array` methods

`ActiveRecord_Relation`s inherit from `Array`, so all `Array` methods work:

 - `.each`
 - `.at()` (and its aliases `[]`, `.first` for `.at(0)`, `.last` for `.at(-1)`)
- `.count`
 - `.reverse`
 - `.sample`
 - `.shuffle`
 - etc

### `.where`

Call `.where` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to filter the array of records based on some criteria:

```ruby
thing.where(arg1)
```
 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation` **regardless of how many results there are**. In particular, even if there is only one result, _the return value will still be another `ActiveRecord_Relation`_.

    - Do not attempt to treat **an array with 1 record in it** like **1 record**. _Those are not the same thing._
    
        If you want the record itself, then retrieve the first element out of the array with `.at(0)` or its alias `.first`.
    - If you attempt to retrieve the first element of an empty array, you will get `nil`.
    
        If you then proceed to call a method on `nil` that doesn't make sense, you will receive an error like `undefined method "caption" for nil`.
    
        The issue is _not_ that the method caption is undefined for nil; the issue is that you previously got 0 results. _Figure out what was wrong with your criteria._
 - `arg1` is usually a `Hash`:
    - Filtering by an exact match within a column:

        ```ruby
        { :id => 42 }
        ```

    - Filter by multiple columns at once:

        ```ruby
        { :photo_id => 23, :user_id => 42 }
        ```

    - Filter using an `Array` (results will match _any_ of the values in the `Array`):

        ```ruby
        { :owner_id => [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] }
        ```

    - Filtering within a range of values:

        ```ruby
        { :created_at => (1.year.ago..Date.today) }
        ```

        ```ruby
        { :last_name => ("A".."C") }
        ```
    - If you _really_ want to, you can omit the curly brackets around the `Hash` for brevity, and Ruby will figure out what you mean. So, ultimately, you can write something like this:

        ```ruby
        Contact.where(:last_name => ("A".."C"))
        ```

        instead of this:

        ```ruby
        Contact.where({ :last_name => ("A".."C") })
        ```

 - `arg1` can also, rarely, be an  `Array`:
    - Filtering by fuzzy matches within a column:

        ```ruby
        ["last_name LIKE ?", "%bet%"]
        ```
    - Filtering by less than or greater than a value:

        ```ruby
        ["created_at <= ?", 1.week.ago]
        ```


        ```ruby
        ["price >= ?", 10_000]
        ```
    - The first element in the `Array` should be a fragment of SQL.
    - The subequent elements in the array are values to be substituted into the SQL fragment where the question marks are. ActiveRecord will first sanitize them to protect against [SQL injection attacks](https://xkcd.com/327/).
    - If you _really_ want to, you can omit the square brackets around the `Array` for brevity, and Ruby will figure out what you mean. So, ultimately, you can write something like this:

        ```ruby
        Contact.where("last_name LIKE ?", "%bet%")
        ```

        instead of this:

        ```ruby
        Contact.where(["last_name LIKE ?", "%bet%"])
        ```
    
 - The `thing` you call `.where` on can be _any_ `ActiveRecord_Relation`:
   - an entire table, e.g. `Photo.all`
   - a previously filtered subset, e.g. `Photo.all.limit(50)`
   - the result of an association helper method, e.g. `current_user.feed`
   - the result of a prior `.where`, e.g. `Photo.where({ :created_at => Date.today.all_week })`; which means you can chain `.where`s one after the other to scope a query down further and further to narrow the result set.

### where.not

Call `.where.not` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to filter the array of records to _exclude_ records based on some criteria:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).where.not({ :first_name => "Mickey" })
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The acceptable arguments to `.not` are the same as to `.where`; see that method for a list.

### .or

Call `.or` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to _combine_ the array of records with another array of records:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :first_name => "Mickey" }).or(Contact.where({ :last_name => "Betina" }))
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.or` must be another `ActiveRecord_Relation` _from the same table_.
 - _Broadens_ the result set.

### .order

Call `.order` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to sort the array based on one or more columns:

```ruby
Contact.all.order({ :last_name => :asc, :first_name => :asc, :date_of_birth => :desc })
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.order` is usually a `Hash`.
    - The keys in the `Hash` must be `Symbol`s that match names of columns in the table. These are the columns that will be used for sorting. If there are multiple keys, the order in which they are provided will be used to break ties.
    - The value associated to each key must be either `:asc` (for ascending order) or `:desc` (for descending order).
 - The argument to `.order` can also just be one `Symbol`, a column name.
 
    ```ruby
    Contact.all.order(:last_name)
    ```

    In that case, `:asc` order is assumed.

### .limit

Call `.limit` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to cap the number of records in the array:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).limit(10)
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.limit` must be an `Integer`.

### .offset

Call `.offset` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to discard the first few records in the array:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).offset(10).limit(10)
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.offset` must be an `Integer`.

### .pluck

Call `.pluck` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to retrieve the values stored in _just one column_ of the records, and discard all other data.

```ruby
Contact.all.pluck(:last_name) # => ["Betina", "Mouse", "Woods"]
```

 - Returns an `Array` of values in the column.
    - _Not_ a single value, even if there was only one record in the `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
    - _Not_ an `ActiveRecord_Relation`, so you can no longer use methods like `.where`, `.order`, etc. You can use `Array` methods like `.each`, `.at`, etc.
 - The argument to `.pluck` must be a `Symbol` that matches the name of a column in the table.
 - You cannot call `.pluck` on an individual ActiveRecord row. If you want the value in a column for an individual row, simply call the accessor method directly:

    ```ruby
    # for an array of records
    people.last_name # bad
    people.pluck(:last_name) # good

    # for an individual record
    person.last_name # good
    person.pluck(:last_name) # bad
    ```

### .maximum

Call `.offset` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to discard the first few records in the array:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).offset(10).limit(10)
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.offset` must be an `Integer`.

### .minimum

Call `.minimum` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to discard the first few records in the array:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).offset(10).limit(10)
```

 - Returns an `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
 - The argument to `.offset` must be an `Integer`.

### .sum

Call `.sum` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to find the sum of the values in a single column:

```ruby
@poem.scores.sum(:points)
```

 - Returns an `Integer` or `Float`, depending on datatype of the column that was summed.
 - The argument to `.sum` must be a `Symbol` that matches the name of a column in the table.

### .average

Call `.average` on an `ActiveRecord_Relation` to find the mean of the values in a single column:

```ruby
@restaurant.reviews.average(:rating)
```

 - Returns an `Integer` or `Float`, depending on datatype of the column that was averaged.
 - The argument to `.average` must be a `Symbol` that matches the name of a column in the table.

## `ActiveRecord` (A single record)

### All column names

You get a method for every column in the table; for example, if you have retrieved an individual record from the `Contact` table, you can call `.first_name`, `.last_name`, etc, on it.

This means that every `ActiveRecord` object will have methods `.id`, `.created_at`, and `.updated_at`, since every table has those columns.

### Any other instance methods you define in the class

It's often helpful to define your own instance methods in the model file; for example, you might want to define a method `.full_name`:

```ruby
class Contact < ApplicationRecord
  def full_name
    return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  end
end
```

You would then be able to call `.full_name` anywhere in the application that you wind up with an individual `Contact` object.

### Association Helper Methods

#### belongs_to

Let's say I have a movie in a variable `m`. It is annoying and error prone to, whenever I want the director associated with a movie, have to type

```ruby
d = Director.where({ :id => m.director_id }).at(0)
```

Wouldn't it be great if I could just type

```ruby
d = m.director
```

and it would know how to go look up the corresponding row in the directors table based on the movie's `director_id`?

Unfortunately, I can't, because `.director` isn't a method that `Movie` objects automatically know how to perform â€” the method would be undefined. (`Movie` objects know how to perform `.director_id` because we get a method for every column in the table.)

We could define such an instance method in the model ourselves without too much trouble. But, fortunately, since domain modeling and associations are at the heart of every application's power, Rails gives us a shortcut. Go into the `Movie` model and add a line like this:

```ruby
belongs_to(:director, { :class_name => "Director", :foreign_key => "director_id" })
```

This line tells Rails:

 - `belongs_to`: We only one result (not an array of results).
 - `:director`: Define a method called `.director` for all movie objects.
 - `:class_name => "Director"`: When someone invokes `.director` on a movie, go fetch a result from the directors table.
 - `:foreign_key => "director_id"`: Use the value in the `director_id` column of the movie to query the directors table for a row.

This is exactly what we would do if we defined the instance method by hand:

```ruby
def director
  return Director.where({ :id => m.director_id }).at(0)
end
```

Either way, we now can utilize this handy shortcut anywhere in our application when we have a movie `m` and we want to get the record in the directors table associated with it:

```ruby
m.director
```

Even better, if you've named your method and foreign key column conventionally (exactly matching the name of the other table), you can use the super-shorthand version:

```ruby
belongs_to(:director)
```

 - If you omit specifying the `:class_name`, Rails assumes that the table that you want to query is named the same thing as the method you are defining.
 - If you omit specifying the `:foreign_key`, Rails assumes that the foreign key column is named the same thing as the method plus `_id`.
 - If either of those things happens to not be true, then just include the `Hash` as the second argument to `belongs_to` and spell it all out:

    ```ruby
    belongs_to(:owner, { :class_name => "User", :foreign_key => "poster_id" })
    ```

    This would give us a method called `.owner` that returns a `User`, even though the foreign key column is called `poster_id`. We still have complete control, if we need to depart from conventional method/foreign key names for some reason.

#### has_many

Let's say I have a director in a variable `d`. It is annoying and error prone to, whenever I want the films associated with the director, have to type

```ruby
f = Movie.where({ :director_id => d.id })
```

Wouldn't it be great if I could just type

```ruby
f = d.movies
```

and it would know how to go look up the corresponding rows in the movies table based on the director's `id`?

Unfortunately, I can't, because `.movies` isn't a method that `Director` objects automatically know how to perform â€” the method would be undefined.

We could define such an instance method in the model ourselves without too much trouble. But, fortunately, since domain modeling and associations are at the heart of every application's power, Rails gives us a shortcut. Go into the `Director` model and add a line like this:

```ruby
has_many(:movies, { :class_name => "Movie", :foreign_key => "director_id" })
```

This line tells Rails:

 - `has_many`: We want many results in an array.
 - `:movies`: Define a method called `.movies` for all director objects.
 - `:class_name => "Movie"`: When someone invokes `.movies` on a director, go fetch results from the movies table.
 - `:foreign_key => "director_id"`: Use the `director_id` column of the movies table to filter using the `id` of the director.

This is exactly what we would do if we defined the instance method by hand:

```ruby
def movies
  return Movie.where({ :director_id => self.id })
end
```

Either way, we now can utilize this handy shortcut anywhere in our application when we have a director `d` and we want to get the records in the movies table associated with it:

```ruby
d.movies
```

Even better, if you've named your method and foreign key column conventionally (exactly matching the name of the other table), you can use the super-shorthand version:

```ruby
has_many(:movies)
```

 - If you omit specifying the `:class_name`, Rails assumes that the table that you want to query is named the same thing as the method you are defining.
 - If you omit specifying the `:foreign_key`, Rails assumes that the foreign key column is named the same thing as this model plus `_id`.
 - If either of those things happens to not be true, then just include the `Hash` as the second argument to `belongs_to` and spell it all out:

    ```ruby
    has_many(:filmography, { :class_name => "Movie", :foreign_key => "director_id" })
    ```

    This would give us a method called `.filmography` that returns `Movie`s. We still have complete control, if we need to depart from conventional method/foreign key names for some reason.

#### has_many/through

After you have established all of your one-to-many association helper methods, you can also add many-to-many helper methods with the `:through` option on `has_many`:

```ruby
class Movie < ApplicationRecord
   has_many(:characters)
   has_many(:actors, { :through => :characters, :source => :actor })
end

class Character < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to(:movie)
  belongs_to(:actor)
end

class Actor < ApplicationRecord
   has_many(:characters)
   has_many(:movies, { :through => :characters, :source => :movie })
end
```

## String

### .concat (.+)

Appends the given arguments to a string. when given an integer as an argument, it converts the integer into ASCII code.  

```ruby
"hi".concat(33) # => "hi!"
```

```ruby
"Rub".concat(121)  # => "Ruby"
```

When given a string literal as an argument, it adds that string to the original string. `.+` or `+` is shorthand for `.concat` method. Each line of code below will give the same output.  

`"hi".concat(" there")`  
`"hi".+(" there")`  
`"hi" +(" there")`  
`"hi" + " there"`  
> "hi there!"

`.+` or `+` will throw an error when passed an integer because the ruby interpreter thinks you are trying to add string to an integer.  
`"hi".+(33)`  
`"hi" + 33`
> ERROR!


**\* method:**  
Multiplies the original string by the given integer.  
`"Ya" * 5`
> "YaYaYaYaYa"

`"Ya" * 0`
> ""

**.upcase method:**  
Converts all lowercase letters to their uppercase counterparts in the given string.  
`"hello".upcase`
> "HELLO"

**.downcase method:**  
Converts all the uppercase letters to their lowercase counterparts in the given string.  
`"HI".downcase`
> "hi"

**.swapcase method:**  
Converts all the uppercase letters to their lowercase counterparts and lowercase letters to their uppercase counterparts in the given string.  
`"Hi There".swapcase`
> "hI tHERE"

`"hI tHERE".swapcase`
> "Hi There"

**.reverse method:**     
Returns a new String with the characters from the original String in reverse order.  
`"stressed".reverse`  
> "desserts"  

**.length method:**  
Returns the character length in a String as an integer.  
 `"hippopotamus".length`
> 12


**.chomp method:**  
When not given any argument, removes the "\n" (newline) character from the end of the string. When given an argument of a charcter or a string, it remove that argument from the *end* of the orginal string.  
`"Hey!\n".chomp`  
`"Hey!".chomp("!")`  
`"Hey There".chomp("There")`  
`"Hey!".chomp("y")`
>"Hey!"  
>"Hey"  
>"Hey "  
>"Hey!"

```
p "What is your name?"
name = gets # supposes the user inputs "Clark" and then hits return
p "Hi" + name
```
>"Hi Clark\n"  

```
p "What is your name?"
name = gets # supposes the user inputs "Clark" and then hits return
p "Hi" + name.chomp
```
>"Hi Clark"

```
p "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp # supposes the user inputs "Clark" and then hits return
p "Hi" + name
```
>"Hi Clark"

**.gsub method:**  
Substitutes the all occurances of the first argument with the second argument in original string.  
`"Hello".gsub("ello", "i")`
>"Hi"  

`"Hi.there".gsub(".", " ")`  
>"Hi there"  

Giving an empty string as the second arugment deletes any occurences of the first arugument in the string.   
`"example @ ruby.com".gsub(" ", "")`  
>"example@ruby.com" 

**.to_i method:**  
Converts a string literal that contains a number to an integer.  
`"8".to_i`
>8

```
p "What is your lucky number?"
lucky_number = gets.chomp # Suppose the user types is "7" and then hits return
square = lucky_number ** 2 # This will throw an error.
```
>NoMethodError (undefined method '**' for "7":String)

This is where the `.to_s` method comes handy.
```
p "What is your lucky number?"
lucky_number = gets.chomp # Suppose the user types is "7" and then hits return
square = lucky_numbe.to_i ** 2 # This will throw an error.
p square
```
>"49"

**.strip method:**  
Removes all leading and trailing whitespace in the string.  
`"   hi there ".strip`
>"hi there"

**.capitalize method:**  
Capitalizes the first character of a string.  
`"capitalize".capitalize`
>"Capitalize"

**.split method:**  
Splits a string into an substrings and creates an Array of these substrings. when not given argument, `.split` uses whitespace to divide the string. when given an argument, `.split` divides the string on that argument.  
`"Hello hi byebye".split`
>["Hello", "hi", "byebye"]

`"one!two!three!".split("!")`
>["one", "two", "three"]`

### Class Integer
whole numbers

**Math Operations for the Integer Class:**   
`12 + 5 # => 17`  
`12 - 5 # => 7 `  
`12 * 5 # => 60`  
`12 / 5 # => 2`  
The `/` operator for integers only returns a whole number and omits the remainder.

`%` **(modulus) operator:**  
Returns the remainder from a divisions.  
`13 / 5 # => 3`

`**` **operator:**  
Raises a number to a power.  
`3 ** 2 # => 9`  
`2 ** 3 # => 8`

**.odd? and .even? methods:**  
Returns a *boolean* based on whether the integer is odd or even.  
`7.odd?`
>true

`8.odd?`
>false

`8.even?`
>false

`7.even?`
>false

**.to_s method:**  
Converts an integer to a string literal.  
`8.to_s`
>"8"

```
lucky_number = rand(10) # assigns a random integer between 0 to 9 to the variable lucky_number
p "My lucky number is " + lucky_number + "!" 
```
The above block of code won't work and will throw an error. 
>**TypeError (no implicit conversion of Integer into String)**

This is where the `.to_s` method comes handy. 
```
lucky_number = rand(10) # assigns a random integer between 0 to 9 to the variable lucky_number
p "My lucky number is " + lucky_number.to_i + "!" 
```
>"My lucky number is 7!"

`"There are " + 7.to_s + " pineapples."`
>"There are 7 pineapples"

**.to_f method:**  
converts an integer to a float(decimal).  
`7.to_f`
>7.0

### Class Float
decimals

**Math Operations for the Float Class:**  
Standard operations are similar to those for the Integer class. The only exception is the `/` operator which returns fractional results.  
`12 / 5 # => 2`  
`12.0 / 5.0 # => 2.4`  
`12 / 5.0 # => 2.4`  
`12.0 / 5 # => 2.4`  

`**` **operator:**  
The `**`operator for Floats can additionally be used to calculate roots.  
`9 ** 0.5 # => 3.0, since 9^(1/2) = sqaureroot of 9`  
`8 ** (1/3.0)# => 2.0, since 8^(1/3) = cuberoot of 8`  

**.round method:**  
Returns the whole part of a decimal when not given any argument.  
`3.14159.round # => 3`  
When given an argument, returns a decimal rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the argument.  
`3.14159.round(3) # => 3.142`  
`3.14139.round(3) # => 3.141`  

**.to_i method:**  
Converts a float to an integer by rounding the float down to closest whole number.  
`"8.9".to_i`  
>8

`"8.1".to_i`  
>8

#### Integer and Float division examples
`12 / 5 # => 2`  
`(12 / 5).to_f # => 2.0`  
`12.to_f / 5 # => 2.4`  
`12 / 5.to_f # => 2.4`  
`(12.0 / 5 ).to_i # => 2`  
`(12 / 5.0).to_i # => 2`  

### Class Date

**Creating a Date:**  
To use the Date class in a Ruby program, we need to say:  
`require "date"`  
***Note:***
Only *Ruby* programs need to have a `require` statement for the Date class. *Rails* already does this for you.

**Date.new**  
Use the `.new` method to create a new instance of a Date object. The `.new` method can be used with or without argument. When given no arguments, the default date is set to *Jan 1st, -4712 BCE*.
```
Date.new                  # => #<Date: -4712-01-01 ((0j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
Date.new(2001)            # => #<Date: 2001-01-01 ...>
Date.new(2001,2,3)        # => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.new(2001,2,-1)       # => #<Date: 2001-02-28 ...>
```
**Date.today**  
Initializes a Date object to the current date.   
`Date.today # => #<Date: 2019-04-16 ((2458590j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>`  

**Date.parse()**  
Returns an Date object initialized to a date, interpreted from the given String argument.
```
Date.parse("2001-02-03") # => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.parse("20010203") # => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.parse("3rd Feb 2001") # => #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
```

**Subtraction**  
Two dates can be subtracted from one another. The `-` operator returns a Rational which can be converted into an Integer to find the days in between the two dates.  
```
number_of_days = Date.today - Date.parse("July 4, 1776") 
# => number_of_days = (88674/1)
number_of_days.to_i # => 88674
```

**Date.mday**  
Returns the day of the month (1-31).
```
held_on = Date.new(2001,2,3)
held_on.mday # => 3
```

**Date.wday**  
Returns the day of the week (0-6, Sunday is 0).
```
held_on = Date.new(2001,2,3)
held_on.wday # => 6
```
**Days of the Week**  
```
date = Date.new
date.monday? # => true if date is a Monday.
date.tuesday? # => true if date is a Tuesday.
date.wednesday? # => true if date is a Wednesday.
date.thursday? # => true if date is a Thursday.
date.friday? # => true if date is a Friday.
date.saturday? # => true if date is a Saturday.
date.sunday? # => true if date is a Sunday.
```

### Class Array

list of objects represented with square brackets, [].


**Creating an Array:**  
`.new` initializes a new empty Array.  
`cities = Array.new # => cities = []`  
or  
`cities = [] # => cities = []` 

**.push method:**  
Adds elements to an Array. 
```
cities.push("Chicago")
cities.push("Los Angeles")
cities.push("New York City")
```
or  
`cities = ["Chicago", "Los Angeles", "New York City"] # Initializes and adds elements to an Array`
> cities = ["Chicago", "Los Angeles", "New York City"]

**.at method:**  
Takes an Integer argument and return the element in that position of an Array. The following lines of code show the various forms of the `.at` method and return the same output.  
`cities.at(2)`  
`cities.[](2)`   
`cities[2]`
>"New York City"

***Note:***
1. Ruby indexes the elements in an array starting at *zero*, that is, the first element of an array will have the index *zero*.
2. Trying to access an element using an index greater than the length of the array will give you `nil`.  
`cities.at(3) # => nil`
3. Using a negative index will retrieve elements from the end of the least.   
`cities.at(-1) # => "New York City"`  
`cities.at(-2) # => "Los Angeles"`  
`cities.at(-3) # => "Chicago"`   
`cities.at(-4) # => nil` 

**.first and .last methods:**  
Retrieve the first and the last element of an array.  
`cities.first # => "Chicago"`  
`cities.last) # => "New York City"`

**.index method:**  
Returns the index of an element.  
`cities.index("Los Angeles") # => 1`

**.count method:**  
Returns the number of elements in a list, when give no arguments. If given an argument, returns the number of times that arguments occurs in the array.
```
nums = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3]
nums.count # => 6
nums.count(3) # => 2
nums.count(2) # => 0
```

**.reverse method:**  
Returns a new Array with the elements of the original Array but in the reversed order.  
`nums.reverse # => [3, 23, 19, 1, 3, 8]`

**.sort method:**  
Returns a new Array with the elements of the original Array but in the sorted in increasing order.  
`nums.sort # => [1, 3, 3, 8, 19, 23]`

**Example: Sorting an Array in decreasing order**
```
nums = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3]
nums.sort # => [1, 3, 3, 8, 19, 23] 
nums.reverse # => [3, 23, 19, 1, 3, 8] 
nums.sort.reverse # => [23, 19, 8, 3, 3, 1], first sorts then reverses the Array. 
```
**.shuffle method:**  
Returns a new Array with the elements of the original Array but with the order shuffled randomly.  
`nums.shuffle # => [3, 23, 8, 19, 1, 3]`  
`nums.shuffle # => [19, 3, 1, 8, 3, 23]` 

**.sample method:**  
Returns a random element from the array.  
`nums.sample # => 23`  
`nums.sample # => 3`

**.min and .max methods:**  
Retrieve the elements of minimum and the maximum values in the array.  
`nums.min # => 1`  
`nums.max # => 23`

**.sum method:**  
Returns the sum of all the elements in the array.  
`nums.sum # => 57`
 
### Class Hash

list of objects represented with curly brackets, {}. Unlike Arrays, each cell is not automatically numbered but given a label by us.

#### Interlude: Class Symbol
Symbols are a sequence of characters and are used to to label something internally in the code. They are created by starting them off with a colon and follow the same naming conventions as variables, `:hello`.  
`:hello.class # => Symbol`  

**Creating a Hash:**  
`person1 = Hash.new`  
or  
`person2 = {}`

**.store method:**  
Adds elements to a Hash by taking two arguments, a label (or *key*) and a piece of data (or *value*). 
```
person1.store(:first_name, "Raghu")
person1.store(:last_name, "Betina")
person1.store(:role, "Instructor")
# => person1 = {:first_name=>"Raghu", :last_name=>"Betina", :role=>"Instructor"}
```
or we can fill up a hash by typing in the hash literal  
`person2 = { :first_name => "Jocelyn", :last_name => "Williams", :role => "Student" }`

***Note:***
1. Ruby represents each key/value pair by separating them with a `=>`, known as a "hash rocket."
2. If the value associated with a key already exists when you try to `.store` something under it, its value will be replaced.

**.fetch method:**  
Both `.fetch` and `.[]` can be used to retrieves the data held by a key.
`person1.fetch(:last_name)# => "Betina"`  
`person2.[:last_name] # => "Williams"` 

If `.fetch` is given key that is not present in the hash, it will throw an error. But `.[]` is given key that is not present in the hash, it returns nil. 

Fallback: pass in a second default argument that `.fetch` will return if the key is not present in the hash.  
`person1.fetch(:middle_name, "None provided") # => "None provided"`

### Conditionals

Basic Anatomy of multibranch `if` statements:
```
if condition1
  # do something if condition1 is true
elsif condition2
  # do something if condition2 is true
else # if both condition1 and condition2 were falsy
  # do something else
end
```

**Example:**
```
p "Type a number less than 10 and greater than 0:"
user_input = gets.chomp.to_i # gets user input, removes newline character, converts the string to integer. 
if user_input == 5 
  p "You win!" # Will print this if the user input is 5
elsif user_input < 10 && user_input > 0 # check if the user input is valid
  p "You lose!" # Will print this if the user input is between 1 and 9
else
  p "You didn't type in a valid number." # Will print this if the user input is not between 1 and 9
end
```
**Don't forget the `end` keyword.**

### Loops
**while statements:**  
`while` is similar to `if`. The difference is everytime the execution of the program reaches the `end` it jumps back and evaluates the *truthiness* of the condtion next to the `while` statement and decides whether or not to execute the code within the `while` loop.
```
while condition 
  # do something while condition is true
end # jump back to the while statement
```

**Example:**
```
limit = 5
while limit > 0 
  p limit
  limit = limit - 1
end 
```
>5  
>4  
>3  
>2  
>1  

***Note:***  
If the condition next to the `while` always evaluates to be "truthy," then the program will be stuck in a neverending loop, infamously known as an
**infinite loop**.

#### Blocks
**.times:**  
The `.times` method will execute the code within a block the number of times specified by the integer. A block of code is the code written in between the keywords `do` and `end`.
```
10.times do
  p "Hi"
end
```
The above block of code will print "Hi" 10 times all on newlines. 

To keep a track of the iteration number, `.times` can create a block variable that starts of counting the iteration number starting at *zero*. After each execution of the code within the block, the block variable is incremented by 1.  

```
10.times do |counter|
  p counter
end
```
The above block of code will print the numbers 0 to 9 all on newlines. 

#### Other methods
**.upto:**    
```
5.upto(10) do |counter|
  # do something
end
```
The above block of code starts the block variable `counter` at 5 and executes the block until counter is 10. 

**.downto:**  
`.downto` is similar to `.upto` except instead of incrementing the block varible, it decrements the block varible by 1.
```
10.downto(5) do |counter|
  # do something
end
```
The above block of code starts the block variable `counter` at 10 and executes the block until counter is 5. 

**.step:**
```
1.step(10, 3) do |counter|
  p counter
end
```
> 1  
> 4  
> 7  
> 10  

The above block of code starts the block variable `counter` at 1 and executes the block until counter is 10 but after each iteration the `counter` will be incremented by 3 instead of 1. `.step` can also be used to decrement the counter by a certain value. 
```
10.step(1, -4) do |counter|
  p counter
end
```
>10  
>6  
>2  

#### Looping through Arrays

**.each:**  
We could loop through an array with the `.times` method but the easier way of doing it is with the `.each` method. Given an array, the `.each` method will loop through each element of the array starting with the very first one. 
```
cities = ["Chicago", "LA", "NYC"]
cities.each do |city|
  p city
end
```
>"Chicago"  
>"LA"  
>"NYC"

The block variable `city` holds the value of the elements in the array `cities`. It starts with the first element `"Chicago"` and then changes with each interation, holding the value of the next element (`"LA"`) in the array and so on.
 
**.each_with_index:**  
To keep a track of the iteration number while looping through an array, `.each_with_index` creates an additional block variable that starts of counting the iteration number starting at *zero*. After each execution of the code within the block, the block variable is incremented by 1.  
```
cities.each_with_index do |city, count|
  p count.to_s + " " + city
end
```
>"0 Chicago"  
>"1 LA"  
>"2 NYC"

`city` holds the value of elements in the array `cities`. `count` holds the index of the element that `city` currently holds. 

***Note:***  
Variables created as a block variables can only be used within that block (between `do` and `end`). Using that variable outside that block will throw an error.
